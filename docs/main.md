## What for?
The root functionality of methodus is the ability to control the program flow by injecting logic to the gap between a caller and a callee of a function.
This ability is very useful when developing distributed / dynamic applications,  allowing developers to use an agile, contained approach in their code logic.





>#### From the dungeon master,
My fellow adventures developer, I welcome you into Methodus. 
You did not arrive here by mistake, nor was it an accident, it is your fate.
Methodus will guide you through the evolution of your application as it grows and gains complexity.
But first you should ask yourself this:
1. Do you wish to build a nodejs based api monolithic server?
2. Would you like to be able to break this monolith into micro-services as you scale it out?
3. How about an automatic testing plugin, allowing you to autodocument your apis and test them?
4. Would you like to concentrate on your logic code only, without the need to wire it to a specific framework?
5. How about event sourcing would you like some of that?
6. Are you using typescript?
7. Do you need a frontend for this server?
